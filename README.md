## How to Play

Random Blocks will fall one at a time.

Falling Blocks can be rotated and moved left and right, so that they can fill in rows.

Fill a row to clear it.

You level up every time you clear 5 rows.

As you increase your level the blocks will start to fall faster.

Game will end when no more blocks can enter the board from the top of the board.

## Blocks

There are seven types of blocks falling down. In the shape of the letters: L, J, T, S, Z, I and O. All the blocks can be rotated and moved while falling, so you can control where they are placed.
